# InGamePanel

The aim of this project is to streamline the creation of `InGamePanels` for `Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020`. After modifying the `Scripts.py` file with the project's Name, Creator, and the title of the window to be displayed, the project will automatically incorporate this information and launch `Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020` to build the project, generating the `.spb` file. The project will be ready for export to `Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020`.

# Requirements

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.7.0/node-v20.7.0-x64.msi)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.5/python-3.11.5-amd64.exe)

# How to use

1. Open the `Scripts.py` file and modify the following information: `{project-name}`, `{project-creator}`, and `{project-title}` where:
   - `{project-name}`: Name of the package to be exported to Microsoft Flight Simulator (e.g. `toolbar-pushback`)
   - `{project-creator}`: Developer/company name (e.g. `Helbert`, `SkyX Simulations`)
   - `{project-title}`: Title of the addon window (e.g. `Toolbar Pushback`)
2. Save the file.
3. Double-click to execute the script.
4. If the script does not execute upon double-clicking, open the Windows terminal (e.g. `CMD`) and enter the following command:
```python
python Scripts.py
```
5. You just need to change the `MyPanel.html`, `MyPanel.css` and, `MyPanel.js` on the `Community/html_ui/InGamePanels/` folder

# How to test

1. Copy the folder inside `Community` folder to the `Community` folder from `Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020`
2. Open the `Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020`.
